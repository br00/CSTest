# CSTest
Clearescore test. Retrieve and display the score using the api provided. 
Check the current app for some design guidelines.

The current test has been done using the latest android technologies as Architecture Components, RX, Dagger, Retrofit, Kotlin.
The project follows a Clean Architecture and MVVM pattern. 
The architecture is clean but maybe it's not that "scholastic" but it should be good enough to be applied in a real production scenario.
There are few test specifically for the viewmodel and the api that has been mocked using MockWebServer.
